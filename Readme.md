Using the Random Number Gods

Known Gods
==========

The LCG
-------

The LCG is a simple god, great for supplicants after speed who do not mind
certain simplicities.  In ages past the LCG was known as Linear congruential
generator, but most just know him by his shorter name in modern times.

The true name of the LCG is best written as:
```c
x = seed * A + C
```

It is said the true names for the A and C, are 1664525 & 1013904223, deriving
from the ancient scriptures _Numerical Receipes in C_.

The Dethread Deity
------------------

The scriptures are clear, in that many of the other the Random Number Gods do
handle the cries of a thousand supplicants all crying out at once.
Unfortunately many of the believers require their deities to answer calls from
different parts of the great tapestry of life (sometimes called _threads_ in
other scriptures).

The dethread deity however can handle all, and will take care to deliver the
messages to and from another deity safely.  With the dethread deity relaying
your prayers, you can be safe in the knowledge that the message will get there
and back safely.  Never a Miscommunication
